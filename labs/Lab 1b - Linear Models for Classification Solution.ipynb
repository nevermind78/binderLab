For instance, trousers and bags are almost always predicted correctly, while sneakers are occasionally confused with sandals or boots. Shirts, on the other hand, are misclassified close to half of the time, predominantly confused with t-shirts, pullovers, and coats."

    "Remember that linear models are typically binary classifiers. They will solve multi-class problems in a one-vs-all approach. Hence, for a 10-class problem, they will build 10 models, each one trained to predict whether an instance is from a specific class or not. This leads to 10 sets of 784 trained coefficients. Above, we plot them as 28x28 matrices, such that each coefficient is plotted at the location of their corresponding pixel value.\n",

In other words, the very bright and very dark pixels in the images are the pixels that the model is mainly 'looking' at to make a prediction. We can easily recognize the shapes of the fashion items for each class. For instance, for classifying a t-shirt (yes or no), the model will blow up the pixel values near the edges of the shirt, and especially near the shoulders, while it will suppress the background pixel values near the outlines of the shirt. If the sum of all these values is large, it will likely lead to a positive prediction for that class.\n",
